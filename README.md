# Map-Reduce-for-K-Means
Implemented MapReduce to perform K-Means clustering algorithm with gRPC for inter-process communication, handling task distribution, parallel processing, and fault tolerance. Implemented master, mapper, and reducer processes to manage data splitting, intermediate key-value pair computation, and centroid updates.
